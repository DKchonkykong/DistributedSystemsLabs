# Distributed Systems: Client & Server Recap


[← Lab 1](lab-1.md) | [← Back to Main README](README.md) | [Next: Lab 2 →](lab-2.md)


## SMART Objectives
Recap on how to set up a server in .net
How it works with client side code
Sending a client side plain text english message and encrypting it for server side via a translator
How to achieve that through using sockets and ports
Understanding what the relationship is between Client side & Server side


## Completed Tasks
I managed to get the client and server side to talk to each other via using sockets and I managed to write the translator 
meaning that what you type in plain text gets cyphered as something else when sent to the server.

## Reflection

Although it was hard to understand at first what I was supposed to do since I haven't done this before. I sort of then understood what I was supposed to do.
I did have some issues most notably having the translator code actually have the message translated server side but I think I managed to fix it by having the same encryption for both client and server side.
